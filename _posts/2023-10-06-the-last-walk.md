I used to walk a lot. Like a lot.
I guess I still do. But that was before I had a job or anything.
Summers were spent either reading (pre-pc era), gaming (pc-era) or playing guitar
(post pc-era). When I got tired of doing that, it was walk time.

I can't even count how many times I have walked the same few routes when I stayed with
my parents.
There was a sort of comfort thing to it. The same route, see the same things.
Chance to spot people from afar but never close enough to have to talk to them.
Walking past places where you knew certain people lived. Imagining scenarios
in your head all the time of "oh how nice it would be if this happened".
It never did, of course. Just me walking.

The walks became longer in uni. I was starting to get really fed up of 
locking myself in the tiny room. It was strange how one can imprison themselves
through the sheer state of mind. I don't know if we do this to punish ourselves
or simply because we don't know how to reach for anything better. So we walk.
Because we can't quite run away just yet.

In lockdown it became a lot more purposeful.
To go in the forest and walk about barefoot. Listen to Aurora. Maybe even lie 
down and look at the sky through the leaves. Touch some trees. Feed the ducks.

It became a mission almost every day. Probably something like a 5km walk there and then
back again.
Oh the free time that I had.
I'm not sure what that did for my mind in the long run.
At the time it was just a nice way to stop feeling couped up.
Probably made my mind very drifty and unfocused.
I usually just thought of the past. 

I still don't think of the future very often. But I don't dwell on the past either.
Life's become simple in that way. Work on some simple things and just get better.
The escapes are still there, they've just changed face and masquarade themselves
as being more useful to my productivity. Going to the gym is really not that different
to going for a walk in the forest and taking your shoes off.
Its still escape. Now with the 6-pack DLC thrown in.

But to the title of the story...

I would often play a game with myself on these walks and tell myself that this is going to
be the last walk. Maybe I wanted to trick myself out of my sleepwalking life stupor.
Have a Dostoevsky moment where he was meant to get shot and accepted death but
was pardonded at the last minute. To try and get close to imagining what
that must have felt like and how much that feeling lasted in his life.
We are just too comfortable in the everyday.
So I'd say to myself this is it. You can start this circle around the pond here.
Once you walk this full circle you will die. Drop dead. No ceremony about it.
So take this walk and think about what you want to think about.
Really let it sink in. What becomes important during a moment like that?

The sun always seemed so beautiful. It was somehow always setting at these moments.
You walk slowly and look at the life in the pond. Did the geese know they were going
to die? When they got old perhaps, did they feel like they were maybe on their last
lap around the pond?

And at that point life does slow down. You look at the house across the road that
you've never been to. Cars going by with people you will never speak to.
Every blade of grass so precious. You don't want to go. You just want to take a seat on that
bench over there and just stay here. But you keep walking. You know you must.
You told yourself this is it.
And it starts to dawn on you a bit. You maybe think of your parents, your friends.
But mostly, its your immediate surroundings you are connected to.
Your eyes are more open for the first time.
And yet the regrets still weigh. There isn't a fight over those regrets.
Just a resignation.
We fight for strange things at strange times.
But in this peacefulness its hard not to accept the inevitability of this walk.
So you keep going. Close off the circle. And then you stop. 
Take a deep breath.
Last thoughts might start flashing quickly. A tiny wave of panic.

But what awaits isn't really scary. A deep warm ocean. The wind is cold and you
know you can't stay here. You have gotten to this point and the regrets don't 
haunt you enough to want to fight. The relationships arent what's in your head.
Its always been the acceptance of this. The knowing that this is where all roads lead.
A small sadness. A big embrace.

You take one more step.

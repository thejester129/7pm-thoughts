When you die you are placed blindfolded in a red rosy room, the colour of organs
or eyelids when warm sunlight shines through them.
You have to find your partner from life through the countless bodies
standing in the room.
The people in the room are not whole and mostly undistinguishable,
all in the shape of a blank body canvas with few clues as to who they are.
They are also blind. They stand still and wait.

This vision kept coming to me.
To truly love someone is to both want and be able to find them in that room.
Maybe its a slight smile that will give them away.
Or their particular warmth.
A passing smell.
The way they might blindly gaze out in the distance but still feel you near,
recognise your presence just as you recognise theirs.

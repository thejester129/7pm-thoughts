This blog took a little bit to setup. Never used Ruby before.
If jekyll is good enough for geohot, its good enough for me right.
Navigating package installs is as fun as banging your head against a brick wall.
Got there in the end.

So why write? Or maybe, more relevantly why did I stop writing?
I think a lot is to do with what goes on in your head everyday.
And what goes on surely mirrors what you are doing in life.
Doesn't explain why I have massive periods of non stop music improvision
extravaganza in my head during every free moment sometimes despite
not even attempting to write music for months but guess some things just stick.

But I used to have thoughts all the time. Wrote them in notes in my 
phone at strangest times and in unexpected places.
But I also used to read non-fiction. Life is a bit different now.
Reading about signal processing doesn't quite fire up the same poetic thoughts.

But I felt it back again yesterday. Reading imaginative stories
from imaginative people for the first time in a good while.
It's nice to feel full of life sometimes. It's not very practical. But it's nice.

So I guess im here to make sure I stay in touch with this part of life.
I've done my time concentrating on the real world and implementation details.
Now seems like a pretty good time to take a break and theorise what is actually
going on in life. I don't think implemenation details are going to help much there.

Why do wars start? Can that really be broken down to implemenation details?
It starts in our heads. Even if its over borders. Or power. Or the nation and its people.
Are all these not just in our heads?

This must be understood first. I don't think life is worth living if it's missing this kind of 
understanding. It feels like it'd be missing the whole point.
As Kundera said there's a beauty to be missed by not paying attention to the little
signs and coincidences and FATE thrown our way. At an even more basic level,
missing the reasons and meanings behind things that are beyond <b>man hungry</b>
and <b>power good</b> seems quite sad.

Rambling now. This is as much for myself as it is for good help anyone reading this.
But why not keep it out here. Its a convinient little cloud storage.
There's no benefit to a folder of notes noone ever reads.

I don't think I ever seriously considered writing a book, despite how much I 
read when I was younger. I admire the time, everyday effort and often pain
that writers must go through to put chapter after chapter of well formed work out there.
I'm too lazy and prefer of thinking up of cool ideas rather than actually
executing something and putting it out to the world.

Maybe these will get better over time. No promises though. Throw enough sh*t at a wall...
